# <Random Number Generator>

##Description

My motivation behind this project was to be able to create a random number generator using prompts, confrims, and alert windows.
I wanted to put this project together to see if I could put together a randomizer meeting requirements given to us by the user.
I learned how to use math methods and slightly more complex logic to funnel answers and create a desired result.
